I chose these style changes to improve clarity and readability while the user reads the website.
I started with the body font because typography shapes the mood of a page and affects readability. 
Helvetica has a sans serif look and gives the interface a clean and easy to read look. 
Removing the default margin lets the header stretch across the full width of the screen, creating a a cleaner look at the top of the page.

The header design focuses attention on site identity. 
A maroon background with white text creates a contrast, which allows for a clear title and makes the title easier to read from a distance. 
Increasing the font size shows its importance and helps people who visit quickly recognize where they are on the site.

I added padding to headings and paragraphs to keep the text from being too close together. 
Small spacing adjustments reduce visual noise and allow for easier reading. 
Many visitors skim webpages, so readable spacing helps them locate details in the different sections of the site.

Image styling received a change because images often interrupt the readability of the site. 
Adding margin creates space around each image so text does not sit too close to the edge. 
Padding inside the border separates the picture from the frame, which looks better than if it was close to the edge. 
The light gray border acts as a container for the image, helping users seperate imagea from main text.

Color highlights on bold and emphasized text serve as a highlight for those parts. 
Dark green and dark sea green highlightimportant terms, while the yellow and orange combination draws attention to emphasis without blending into the text. 
These color choices support easy reading and help users notice definitions and important features.

Overall, each decision focuses on structure and readability to create a better viewing experience for the user
